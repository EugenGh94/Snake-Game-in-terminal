# Snake-Game-in-terminal
I saw this idea on Cod√©dex's list of "50 terminal project ideas" and I wanted to try it as it seemed almost impossible at first. I managed to make the game work without using classes and with only one coordinate to locate the snake and snacks. This approach made the code easier to understand and work with, but I still need to tweak a few things.
