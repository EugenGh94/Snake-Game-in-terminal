# Snake-Game-in-terminal
I saw this idea on Codédex's list of "50 terminal project ideas" and I wanted to try it as it seemed almost impossible at first.
I thought it would be a good idea to use classes (for an object-oriented programming approach) and a system of 2 coordinates for both snake and snacks.
Unfortunately, my knowledge of classes and ​​​​​oop was enough to make the game work. I managed to make some aspects of it work but not the full game.
I did not give up on the project and eventually I managed to make the game work without using classes and using only one coordinate to locate the snake and snacks.
In the end, I think this approach made the code easier to understand and work with, and even though the game works, I still need to tweak a few things to make it work better.
I worked on this project for about 14-16 hours (4 days, 3/4h per day).

*1. I added a nice banner at the top, a game over banner, a level variable and score. 
I also tweaked a few things to make the game run smoother, but it still has some lag due to terminal limitations.
